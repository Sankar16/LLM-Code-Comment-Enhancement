They help other developers understand why certain functions exist, under which circumstances they operate correctly (input validation), as well as any side effects that might occur upon invocation. By focusing comments around these aspects rather than technicalities like variable names or algorithmic steps involved inside those blocks allows you maintain readability while keeping documentation up-to-date even if changes happen elsewhere outside documented areas such as refactoring existing classes/modules etc.. This approach also ensures consistency across different parts where similar patterns emerge thus making it easier overall comprehension especially among non-expert users who may need guidance navigating through complex systems built over time by multiple contributors working together towards common goals but still respect individual coding styles preferences too!"
