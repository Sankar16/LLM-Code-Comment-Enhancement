# This method is useful for translating text into different languages","# Initializes new locale object using specified language code; useful during localization setup Comments provide essential information about what specific methods do within your application's domain logic without going into detail of their internal workings. They help other developers understand why certain functions exist, under which circumstances they operate correctly (input validation), as well as any side effects that might occur upon invocation. By focusing comments around these aspects rather than technicalities like variable names or algorithmic steps involved inside those blocks allows you maintain readability while keeping documentation up-to-date even if changes happen elsewhere outside documented areas such as refactoring existing classes/modules etc.. This approach also ensures consistency across different parts where similar patterns emerge thus making it easier overall comprehension especially among non-expert users who may need guidance navigating through complex systems built over time by multiple contributors working together towards common goals but still respect individual coding styles preferences too!"

The +options+ parameter is a hash consisting of the following key/value pairs:  <tt>:params</tt>:: a single key or an array of keys that must be in the <tt>params</tt> hash in order for the action(s) to be safely called. <tt>:session</tt>:: a single key or an array of keys that must be in the <tt>session</tt> in order for the action(s) to be safely called. <tt>:flash</tt>:: a single key or an array of keys that must be in the flash in order for the action(s) to be safely called. <tt>:method</tt>:: a single key or an array of keys--any one of which must match the current request method in order for the action(s) to be safely called. (The key should be a symbol: <tt>:get</tt> or <tt>:post</tt>, for example.) <tt>:xhr</tt>:: true/false option to ensure that the request is coming from an Ajax call or not. <tt>:add_flash</tt>:: a hash of name/value pairs that should be merged into the session's flash if the prerequisites cannot be satisfied. <tt>:add_headers</tt>:: a hash of name/value pairs that should be merged into the response's headers hash if the prerequisites cannot be satisfied. <tt>:redirect_to</tt>:: the redirection parameters to be used when redirecting if the prerequisites cannot be satisfied.

It accepts hash arguments where keys correspond to action names requiring verification prior to execution.
