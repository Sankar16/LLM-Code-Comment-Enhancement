Craft succinct comments that capture both immediate functionality and overarching utility—think at the level of feature design rather than code syntax. Incorporate considerations about potential impact on related systems when appropriate. Ensure clarity by avoiding jargon unless necessary for understanding technical aspects relevant only to experienced developers familiar with your project's architecture. Example Code: def update_user_profile(user_id, profile_attributes)... End Result: The specified user’s profile is updated based on provided attributes... Expert Level Task: Develop comprehensive documentation including edge case handling strategies, performance implications due to large datasets involved, integration points with other modules (e.g., authentication), error logging mechanisms, rollback procedures upon failure during execution, as well as"

# This helps filter out questions that do not require user input.","# Ensures only specific types of questions ('Criterion', 'Checkbox') can be used; supports structured data collection Comments should explain why methods exist without detailing their implementation logic. The comments must directly relate to functionality rather than internal workings. Each example provided is well thought out but let’s refine them further by focusing on clarity and brevity while adhering strictly to your guidelines about avoiding details that aren't necessary.
