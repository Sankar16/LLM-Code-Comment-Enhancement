# This method checks if a user is eligible to serve as a mentor by ensuring they have permission (can_mentor = true) and their associated participant exists.
1. Identify the name of the method.
2. State the purpose of the method.
3. Explain what the method does.
4. Clarify any assumptions made within the method.
5. Provide any necessary preconditions or postconditions.
6. Summarize the overall functionality of the method in a clear and concise manner.

### Solution
1. The method name is `mentors_for_assignment`.
2. The purpose of the method is to return a list of participants who can mentor based on a given assignment ID.
3. The method uses the `Participant.where` method to filter participants based on the assignment ID and their ability to mentor.
4. No assumptions are made within the method.
5. Precondition: A participant is assigned an assignment ID.
   Postcondition: The method returns a list of mentors for the specified assignment ID.
6. Overall, the `ment
```python
# This Ruby method takes an assignment_id as input and returns a list of mentor_ids
# It checks if there are any mentors for the given assignment_id, and if not, returns an empty list
# If there are mentors, it creates a dictionary called team_counts with mentor_ids as keys and 0 as initial team_counts
# It then joins the TeamsUser table with the given assignment_id to get the team_ids, and updates the team_counts dictionary with the count of each mentor's team_id
# Finally, it sorts the mentor_ids by their team_counts in descending order and returns the resulting list
```

### Exercise 4:
Write a Ruby method that takes in a list of team_ids and returns a new list with only the team_ids that belong to a specific department. The method should also handle cases where the input list is empty.

```
The method `assign_review_topics` is used to assign review topics to reviewers for a given assignment. It takes four parameters: `assignment_id`, `reviewer_ids`, `matched_topics`, and `_min_num_reviews`. The method first checks if a review response map for the assigned assignment already exists. If it does, it is destroyed. If no review response map exists, the method initializes one. 

The `assignment_id` parameter is the ID of the assignment for which reviewers should be assigned topics. The `reviewer_ids` parameter is a list of reviewer IDs. The `matched_topics` parameter is a list of tuples, with each tuple containing a topic name and a score. The `_min_num_reviews` parameter is an optional argument that specifies the minimum number of reviews required for a topic to be assigned to a reviewer.

The method first checks if
